One of these things...

Dear (insert person, place, or thing here),

My name is Dustin Williams and I am nineteen years old. This is my second year at COCC and I am currently exploring the field of computer science. I love playing video games like most other nineteen year olds, and help my parents run Dancing Beans Coffee in Madras.
